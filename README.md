# Project Description:
This Project is designed to create an application that can be used to work offline and online. It is a simple text editor that you can write down whatever you want in a console.log(). Once you save it, the text that was written is saved so that it can be used or seen when offline.

To start the project, open the terminal. Type `npm run start` into the terminal. The Server will then run and build based on the functions located in the `package.json` file. once this occurs a `dist` folder will be created and this is a compressed version of the live application. once this occurs the server will be live. and display this in the terminal: 
`webpack 5.89.0 compiled successfully in 2874 ms`
`Now listening on port: http://localhost:3000/`

# Javascript Files:
Started with starter code for index.js. Started by installing all npm's that i needed. Fixed issues with files `src-sw.js`, `webpack.config.js`, `package.json`, `database.js`, and `install.js`.

# Github:
Pushed out Starter files, Javascript files, Images, and README when finishing any coding edits, as to ensure I could go back at anytime to earlier designs if need be.
